# hello-world
This is my new repository!

These are the first edits to this repository.
How bout them apples.

##Task 1: Write a command to go to this site and tell me how many releases of ansible are available for download:

https://releases.ansible.com/ansible/

It must be in its own seperate sh file

##Task 2

Get the 2.x.x.0 ansible releases and print them to the user.
Ask the user which version they want
Download that version
Clean up after yourself
